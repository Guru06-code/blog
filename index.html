  <div class="about">
    <p>“Action speaks louder than words” and Mr. Bean truly justifies the statement. Mr. Bean series celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2015. Rowan Sebastian Atkinson portrayed the role of Mr. Bean. Rowan Atkinson may have more than 50 acting credits
      on his resume, but to most of the world he’ll always be best known as the ridiculously rubber-faced Mr. Bean and is undoubtedly the king of comedy.</p>

    <p>1. Mr. Bean started as stage character.



      Though it was on January 1, 1990 that Mr. Bean made his television debut on England’s ITV, Rowan Atkinson began developing the character more than a decade earlier, while he was pursuing his master’s degree in electrical engineering.



      “I was asked in my first term at Oxford to do a sketch in this one-night show at the Oxford Playhouse, and I’d never written anything,” Atkinson recalls in The Story of Mr. Bean, a feature on The Whole Bean DVD. “I’m not really naturally a
      writer, so I just had to invent sort of 5 minutes of something at 48 hours’ notice. I just stood in front of the mirror and started to mess about with my face. And this strange, surreal, sort of non-speaking character evolved.”

    <p>2. Only 14 Episodes Were Ever Produced.



      Shocking, I know. But it's true! Though we all tend to possess the thought that Mr. Bean as an endless source of humor, there were only ever 14 episodes produced. Of course, movies, the animated series, and books made it feel like more. But as
      for the original series, we have just 14 episodes to enjoy. It did, of course, spawn two movies, an animated series, a video game, and some books, including Mr. Bean’s Definitive and Extremely Marvelous Guide to France.

    </p>

    <p>3. The Series Was Broadcast to Nearly 200 Countries Around the World.



      Despite the bulk of the comedy being physical, not narrative, Mr. Bean has not gotten lost in translation. “There does not seem to be a country in the world, or not that I have visited, or indeed none that I have heard of, who do not seem to
      get him, who do not seem to understand and enjoy the character of Mr. Bean,” Atkinson told ABC. “I think, and I’ve always assumed, it’s because he’s basically a child trapped in a man’s body."</p>

    4. Atkinson Rightfully Had Faith in His Face.



    While the beginning of Mr. Bean started by looking in the mirror, Atkinson decided to put faith in what he was doing with his face following the first successful performance at Oxford. “In the sketch the following Sunday, I just went through a
    whole lot of facial expressions,” Atkinson said in a BBC World Service radio interview. “I am not sure whether there was a particular narrative, a logic to it, but I did my best and it certainly solicited laughter. But since then, I have hardly
    ever looked at my face … I hope it is doing what I think it is doing.”

  <p>5. The Guy Who Directed Love Actually Developed the Character with Atkinson.



    Atkinson’s creative partner at the time, along with the man who helped develop the character of Mr. Bean, who was the writer-director-producer Richard Curtis. The two collaborated on Not the Nine O’Clock News and Blackadder before Mr. Bean ever
    hit the airwaves. Curtis later made the jump to the big screen as the writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones’s Diary, and the writer-director of Love Actually, The Boat That Rocked, and About Time.

  </p>

  <p>6. Atkinson Was Inspired by Jacques Tati



    Over the years, Atkinson has repeatedly cited French comedian Jacques Tati as one of the great influences on Mr. Bean. “My interest in physical comedy was from discovering a film by Jacques Tati called Mr. Hulot’s Holiday,” Atkinson says in The
    Story of Bean. “It just struck a chord with me. I so admired it, because it was an uncompromising comic attitude and setting that I really admired.”

    11. Yes, He Really Can Wiggle His Ears



    Mr. Bean’s legendary ear wiggle is one trait Atkinson has in common with his on-screen alter ego. While promoting Mr. Bean’s Holiday, ABC’s David Stratton asked “perhaps the most crucial question of the entire interview: can you really wiggle
    your ears?” To which Atkinson simply replied, “Yes, I can.” The actor says that he really can wiggle his ears like that, and it's not CGI.

  </p>

  <p>12. Mr. Bean Performed at The Olympics



    When London hosted the Summer Olympics in 2012, Mr. Bean was on hand for the opening ceremony, where he ushered in the games with a rendition of “Chariots of Fire.” and to say it was anything less than legendary would be offensive.

  </p>

  <p>13. Atkinson Retired the Role in Late 2012.



    In an interview with The Telegraph in November of 2012, Atkinson admitted that Mr. Bean’s time was coming to an end. “The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me—basically quite physical, quite childish—I increasingly feel I’m
    going to do a lot less of,” Atkinson said. “Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their fifties being childlike becomes a little sad. You’ve got to be careful.”


  </p>
  <p>14. In 2015, Bean Rose Again—For A Funeral.



    Never say never: On March 13, 2015 a brand-new Mr. Bean sketch, “The Funeral,” premiered to celebrate Comic Relief, and in honor of Bean’s 25th anniversary.

  </p>

  <p>15. Mr. Bean’s Creators Could Not Have Predicted Its Success.



    When asked about Mr. Bean’s enduring appeal during a BBC World Service radio interview earlier this year, executive producer Peter Bennett-Jones said, “I don’t think anyone could have anticipated quite how successful and long-lived it would be.
    Coming up to 25 years is an extraordinary thought since we first went on air on January 1, 1990. Mr. Bean’s been very good to us all, so we love Mr. Bean.”
